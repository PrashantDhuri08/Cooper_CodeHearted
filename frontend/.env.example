# Cooper Frontend Environment Variables
# 
# Note: Next.js App Router doesn't require environment variables
# for the current implementation as the API URL is hardcoded.
#
# If you need to change the backend URL, edit lib/api.ts:
# const API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000";
#
# For production deployments, you can use:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
#
# Then update lib/api.ts to:
# const API_BASE_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || "http://localhost:8000";

# Development
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Production (example)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.cooper-app.com
